## Creating a Dynamic Blog with Vite React, Strapi CMS, and Tailwind CSS

In this blog post, we'll guide you through the process of creating a dynamic blog using a modern tech stack. We'll cover everything from setting up the development environment to deploying your blog for public access.

### Introduction

#### What is a dynamic blog?

A dynamic blog is an interactive and data-driven web application that allows you to create, manage, and display blog posts. In this tutorial, we'll show you how to build one using the following technologies:

#### Technologies used in this tutorial

- Vite: A fast build tool for frontend development.
- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Strapi CMS: A headless content management system that makes it easy to manage your blog content.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that helps you create visually appealing and responsive designs for your blog.

### Setting Up the Development Environment

#### Installing Node.js and npm

Before we start, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. If not, you can follow [these instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) to set them up.

#### Creating a new Vite project

To kickstart our project, we'll create a new Vite project. If you're new to Vite, you can learn more about it [here](https://vitejs.dev/guide/). Run the following command to create a new Vite project:

```bash
npx create-vite my-dynamic-blog 
```

#### Installing React and Tailwind CSS
Next, we'll add React and Tailwind CSS to our project. You can do this by running the following commands:
```bash
cd my-dynamic-blog
npm install react react-dom
npm install tailwindcss

```
You can learn more about Tailwind [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

This sets the stage for our dynamic blog project. You can now proceed to build and develop the frontend using React, and integrate Strapi CMS to manage your blog content.

#### Adding Strapi CMS to Your Dynamic Blog

Strapi CMS provides a user-friendly interface for managing your blog content. To integrate Strapi with your dynamic blog, follow these steps:

1. **Install Strapi:** Use the following command to install Strapi globally.

    ```bash
    npm install -g strapi
    ```
2. **Create a New Strapi Project:** Navigate to your blog project folder and run the following command to create a new Strapi project.
    ```bash
    npx create-strapi my-blog-cms
    ```
    

3. **Sign In and Configure Your Strapi Project:** Follow the on-screen prompts to configure your Strapi project. This includes setting up the database, creating content types, and defining API endpoints.

4. **Develop Strapi APIs:** You can easily define and customize your blog content structures within Strapi, including blog posts, authors, and categories.


5. **Connect Your React App:** To connect your React app with Strapi, make API requests to fetch and display blog content. You can use libraries like Axios or the built-in fetch API to interact with your Strapi CMS.

You can use following code to start strapi CMS in your project. Just go to your project directory and type:

```bash
    cd my-blog-cms 
```
Then you can use the following command to start your Strapi CMS.

```bash
    npm run develop
```
