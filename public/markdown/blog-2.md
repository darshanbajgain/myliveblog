## Intro to Web3 Day 1: Intro to Web3

What is Web3To put it simply, **Web3** is the latest version of what we know as the internet. In this version, people have full ownership of their content, data, and assets. There are also no middlemen involved, which is presently the case with large corporations and governments controlling and regulating whatever goes on the internet. In some areas, you may read some terms like decentralized and democratization of the internet being used for Web3, which can be sort of confusing. But for now, think of decentralization as not being controlled and monitored by others, rather, by yourself. Web1 = read  Web1 happened when the internet was officially introduced in the 1980s onwards. Few individuals or groups created content.
